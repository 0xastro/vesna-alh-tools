Welcome to VESNA ALH tools's documentation!
===========================================

The `vesna-alh-tools` provides utilities and Python modules for managing,
accessing and experimenting with VESNA-based wireless sensor networks that are
using the ALH protocol.

This document provides reference documentation for Python modules that provide
convenient access to resources exposed on sensor nodes. As such it is intended
for users of the testbed that want to control their experiments from Python
scripts.

Reference documentation is also available in Python docstrings that are
accessible through the `pydoc` command-line tool.

For a step-by-step tutorial on how to use Python modules with the LOG-a-TEC
cognitive radio testbed, see the `Fed4FIRE tutorial
<http://log-a-tec.eu/cr-etel-tutorial.html>`_.

Command-line utilities, contained in the same package, are intended for use by
testbed administrators. Their use is outside of the scope of this document.
Utilities are briefly documented in the `README
<https://github.com/avian2/vesna-alh-tools/blob/master/README.rst>`_.

For a JavaScript library that is roughly equivalent to Python modules provided
here, see the `vesna-alh-js package <https://github.com/avian2/vesna-alh-js>`_.
